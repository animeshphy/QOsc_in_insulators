# QOsc_in_insulators
This repository has all the data files for the figures we have in our final draft.

All the data files are named according to their order in the final draft
For example a data file MT_1_a.dat refers to the figure 1(a) of the main text. Similarly ST is used to denote Supplementary Text. For all the data files the X-axis is kept in the first column of the .dat file and the y-axis is stored in next columns. There can be multiple columns corresponding to Y-axis as most of the plots have results for different parameter values

All the matlab codes are shared as .m files. They are named according to what quantity they calculate.
